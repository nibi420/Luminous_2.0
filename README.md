# Luminous_2.0

A campus companion app for LUMS made in React Native using Expo. The app is a one-stop shop made to facilitate the University in holding events as well as raise donations for wellfare cases. The details of an event are manually addedd by the host in the app and its location as well as details are shown on a map in the app. The app also has a donations tab where the Welfare Committee of the Student Council can post verified cases and, hence, serve as a fundraiser as well.

The app uses the MERN stack with React Native for the front-end. The map is displayed in-app using the Google Maps SDK. The app itself is a CRUD app and makes use of RESTfull APIs to facilitate requests.

The backend is deployed on Heroku and the front-end production build was constructed using the Expo environment.
